# Food-Recommendation-System-Using-Chroma-DB
build an advanced food recommendation system that demonstrates three distinct approaches to similarity search and conversational AI.
 build an advanced food recommendation system that demonstrates three distinct approaches to similarity search and conversational AI. Using a rich food dataset with detailed nutritional information, ingredients, cooking methods, and taste profiles, you will create an interactive CLI search interface, implement advanced filtering techniques, and develop a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that provides intelligent food recommendations using Chroma DB and natural language processing.

You will learn how to implement interactive user interfaces, metadata filtering, similarity scoring, and conversational AI systems that combine vector search with large language model responses. This lab demonstrates real-world applications of vector databases in creating intelligent recommendation systems and chatbots.
